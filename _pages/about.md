Hi, my name is Meredith Blair Bearov. I have over two decades in high-end culinary and hospitality services. 

My career in hospitality includes pivotal stints at The Inn at Little Washington and Citronnelle; James Beard award-winning, Michelin Stars, Relais & Châteaux, and Relais & Gourmand properties. I have worked in all aspects of the industry, including fine dining, event planning and management, culinary retail, and sales. 

These experiences have equipped me with a unique perspective and an understanding of what it takes to plan and execute exceptional experiences.

***WINE-*** I’ve had the opportunity to work with some spectacular wine collections. As Wine Director and Cellar Master at The Inn at Little Washington, I was responsible for managing a 92-page wine list and overseeing a cellar with more than 29,000 bottles and 2,400 labels.

Over the years, I’ve been fortunate enough to win a Wine Spectator award, and to work alongside three different Master Sommeliers. Their mentorship helped shaped my approach to wine. Whether it’s selecting the perfect pairing for an intimate dinner or curating a list for a large event, I’ve always focused on making wine approachable, exciting, and, above all, fun.

***EVENTS*** In omni enim arte vel studio vel quavis scientia vel in ipsa virtute optimum quidque rarissimum est. Quod est, ut dixi, habere ea, quae secundum naturam sint, vel omnia vel plurima et maxima. Quodsi ipsam honestatem undique pertectam atque absolutam. Tecum optime, deinde etiam cum mediocri amico. Neque enim disputari sine reprehensione nec cum iracundia aut pertinacia recte disputari potest. An, partus ancillae sitne in fructu habendus, disseretur inter principes civitatis, P. Ut in geometria, prima si dederis, danda sunt omnia. Longum est enim ad omnia respondere, quae a te dicta sunt. Nam cui proposito sit conservatio sui, necesse est huic partes quoque sui caras suo genere laudabiles. Servari enim iustitia nisi a forti viro, nisi a sapiente nona.
