Hi, my name is **Meredith Bearov**. I have over two decades in high-end culinary and hospitality services. 

My career in hospitality includes pivotal stints at **The Inn at Little Washington** and **Michel Richard Citronnelle**; James Beard award-winning, Michelin Stars, Relais & Châteaux, and Relais & Gourmand properties. I have worked in all aspects of the industry, including fine dining, event planning, management, culinary retail, and sales. 

These experiences have equipped me with a unique perspective and an understanding of what it takes to plan and execute **exceptional experiences**.

**PRIVATE CHEF \-**  I discovered my love of gardening and food at an early age, thanks to my grandmother. She worked as a Virginia home extension agent in the 1930s and '40s, teaching families how to can, cook, and grow their own food. She was a serious gardener, and some of my earliest memories are of being out in the garden with her.

The best meals start with good, seasonal ingredients. Whether I’m at a local farmers market or in my own garden, I’m always looking for the freshest produce to build a meal around.

I specialize in creating personalized experiences for my clients. Whether it’s an intimate dinner or a special gathering, I work closely with you to design menus that reflect your tastes and preferences. From the initial consultation to shopping for ingredients, selecting wines, and coordinating the event, I handle every detail. We’ll discuss your goals and vision, and I’ll make sure the final experience is exactly what you want.

***WINE \-***  I’ve had the opportunity to work with some spectacular wine collections. As **Wine Director** and **Cellar Master** at The Inn at Little Washington, I was responsible for managing a 92-page wine list and overseeing a cellar with more than 29,000 bottles and 2,400 labels. At Citronnelle, I was blessed to work for Michel Richard and Kathryn Morgan M.S., and to eventually assume the role of Wine Director;  Citronnelle will forever be a **magical** place.

Over the years I've been fortunate enough to earn a **Grand Spectator Award**, and to be recruited by, and work alongside, three different **Master Sommeliers**. Their mentorship, and friendship, helped shape my approach to wine. Whether it’s selecting the perfect pairing for an intimate dinner or curating a list for a large event, I’ve always focused on making wine approachable, exciting, and, above all, fun.

My goal is to give you a **personal chef** experience, crafting meals tailored to your unique needs, whether it's something casual or a more formal event. It’s all about creating something meaningful and memorable, where every dish was made just for you.
