Hi, my name is **Meredith Bearov**. I have over two decades in high-end culinary and hospitality services. 

My career in hospitality includes pivotal stints at **The Inn at Little Washington** and **Michel Richard Citronnelle**; James Beard award-winning, Michelin Stars, Relais & Châteaux, and Relais & Gourmand properties. I have worked in all aspects of the industry, including fine dining, event planning, management, culinary retail, and sales. 

These experiences have equipped me with a unique perspective and an understanding of what it takes to plan and execute **exceptional experiences**.

***WINE \-***  I’ve had the opportunity to work with some spectacular wine collections. As **Wine Director** and **Cellar Master** at The Inn at Little Washington, I was responsible for managing a 92-page wine list and overseeing a cellar with more than 29,000 bottles and 2,400 labels. At Citronnelle, I was blessed to work for Michel Richard and Kathryn Morgan M.S., and to eventually assume the role of Wine Director;  Citronnelle will forever be a **magical** place.

Over the years I've been fortunate enough to earn a **Grand Spectator Award**, and to be recruited by, and work alongside, three different **Master Sommeliers**. Their mentorship, and friendship, helped shape my approach to wine. Whether it’s selecting the perfect pairing for an intimate dinner or curating a list for a large event, I’ve always focused on making wine approachable, exciting, and, above all, fun.

***EVENTS \-*** I specialize in creating **boutique** experiences. Whether it's an intimate gathering or a special celebration, I love working closely with my clients to **plan events** and design custom menus that reflect their tastes, preferences, and the freshest, in-season ingredients. From the initial consultation to shopping at local farmers markets, to wine selection, to event coordination and planning, I personally **curate** every detail. Together, we’ll talk through your **goals**, ensuring that the final experience is a true reflection of your vision.

My goal is to give you a **personal chef** experience, crafting meals tailored to your unique needs, whether it's something casual or a more formal event. It’s all about creating something meaningful and memorable, where every dish was made just for you. My goal is always to turn your event in to something special.
